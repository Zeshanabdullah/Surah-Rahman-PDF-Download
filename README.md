# 🌙 **Why We Created This Repo**

To be very honest — I created this because **I was tired of visiting websites full of ads just to download one Surah**.

Some pages had:
❌ too many popups  
❌ slow download buttons  
❌ heavy layouts  
❌ forced sign-ups  
❌ redirects  
❌ broken links  

And this didn’t feel right for something as pure and spiritual as the Quran.

So I decided:

**“Let’s put Surah Rahman in a safe, clean, and 100% free space — GitHub.”**

This repo gives you:
- Instant access  
- No ads  
- No limits  
- No tracking  
- No signup  
- No nonsense  

Just Surah Rahman in its purest, simplest form.
